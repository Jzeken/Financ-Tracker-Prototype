  This is a prototype of finance tracker app that will monitor and tracks the last price of a stock.

FEATURES
- Authentication System, User can sign up, edit thier profile, log in/out
- Users can track stocks, up to 10 per user. The Profile page will be display all the current stock prices
- Users can search for stock symbols using a search bar
- Users can choose to add a stock from results of search to thier portfolio
- Users can look for friends, or other users of the app, by name or email (first name, last name, email)
- Users can view portfolio of stocks their friends are tracking for investing ideas
- Must be mobile friendly, so the styling has to be responsive (the app uses twitter bootstrap)

The app still has no proper design or UI yet it only depends on twitter-bootstrap, but all are functioning well.
